Java Projects Collection

A collection of Java programs and small projects created to demonstrate my learning journey in Java programming.  
These projects cover **fundamental concepts** such as classes, objects, loops, conditionals, arrays, GUI development, and basic algorithms.



 Project Structure

 Basic Java Programs
Beginner-level programs demonstrating Java syntax, variables, loops, and conditional statements:

- Area.java – Calculates area of a shape  
- For loop.java, Whileloop.java, Forlooparray.java – Looping examples  
- If.java – Conditional statements -if statements 
- Maxnumber.java – Finds maximum number  
- Primenumbers.java– Prime number logic  
-Marks.java – Student marks evaluation  
- Dayexample.java – Day-of-week example using conditionals
